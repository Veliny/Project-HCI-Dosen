                <b>What is Climate Change?</b>
                <br>
                To understand Climate Change first we must understand 
                what a climate is and how is and it's differences from
                weather.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Simply the Climate is state and conditions of the atmosphere 
                or sky on a large time-scale or a long period of time for a 
                particular area or region.
                <br>
                While the weather is the state and conditions of the atmosphere 
                or sky on a small period of time, usually weather indicate what the 
                changes in the atmosphere in the scale of minutes to months.
                <br>
                <br>
                Knowing what a climate is and it's differeces with weather
                , know the term climate change becomes clearer.
                Climate Change is the changing of the usual patterns and conditions
                of the atmosphere.
                <br>
                This effects the normal weather patterns, resulting in the change
                in frequency of certain weathers, for example getting less snow
                or the opposite, getting more snow at a certain time in the year.
                <br><br>
                <b>Is the Climate Changing?</b>
                <br>
                Yes the climate is changing.
                <br>
                The recent trend of the climate is that the avarage tempature of the earth 
                is slowly getting higher/warmer. This has cause significant effects such as
                rising sea levels and warmer oceans.
                <br><br>
                <b>What is Causing the Change?</b>
                <br>
                There has been many fluctuations in the climate in the past 
                thousands to millions of years ago where the climate is warmer or colder.
                Thousands of years ago where human have little ways to effect the climate
                or when humans didn't exists yet the climate can change through natural causes
                , distance from the sun, the state of the sun can change the amount
                of energy it radiates to earth, natural disasters like volcanic erruption
                can spew volcanic ash enough to block the sun the cool the earth.
                <br><br>
                Apart from the natural causes and factors from nature, humans obviously
                can also effect the climate. Our actions that consumes energy inderectly
                can change the climate because of most of those energy we consume
                comes from burning coal, oil and gasses that produces gasses like 
                CO2 that can warm the atmosphere.
